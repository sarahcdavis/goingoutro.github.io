	<p>So, you’re thirsty. You’ve come to the right place. One of the best features I’ve found from using Outro is that it constantly is introducing me to bars I would have never found otherwise bringing me a totally unique assortment of new experiences.</p>
	<h2>1. The Sharkeye</h2>
	<h3>MOTHER OF PEARL - EAST VILLAGE, MANHATTAN</h3>
	<p>95 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009</p>
	<img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59ffef57a8b2b0625b1fae0e/t/5bb4deea71c10b7ebdf56eef/1538580208895/?format=1000w" height="40%" width="40%" style="float: left; margin-right: 40px">
	<p>Not only is this drink absolutely delicious, but the way it’s served is the perfect conversation piece. Normally, I’m not a bourbon fan but who knew it mixed so well with a fresh passion fruit base? This isn’t the typical fall drink but it will absolutely make you reminisce on all the flavors of summer. The drink comes out in a shark shaped glass worthy of its own ooo's and aahh's. The server then sprinkles a ruby-red maraschino cherry glaze on top of the shark to add even more flavor, literally and figuratively. This is the perfect cocktail to order on a first date, giving you plenty of content to talk about for the rest of the night. </p>

	<h2>2. The Pumpkin Head</h2>
	<h3>CANDLE 79 - UPPER EAST SIDE, MANHATTAN</h3>
	<p>154 E 79th St, New York, NY 10075</p>
	<img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59ffef57a8b2b0625b1fae0e/t/5bb4deea71c10b7ebdf56eef/1538580208895/?format=1000w" height="40%" width="40%" style="float: left; margin-right: 40px">
	<p>If you are familiar with that inner warmth that can only be achieved during late October, when you feel a crisp breeze kindly creep through your window but you don’t care because you’re too cozy under your blanket/turtle neck combo, then you’ll like this drink. It is liquid fall. The pumpkin and cinnamon combo and rock vodka gives this drink a flirty undertone. It’s enough for you to want to curl up next to a fireplace and sip on it all night- or just order a couple more with dinner.  </p>
